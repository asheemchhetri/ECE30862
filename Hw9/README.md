HW9 instructions

Write a class IntegerArithmetic that has static functions add, subtract, multiply and divide. The functions should take as arguments two objects: op1 and op2. If op1 is of type Integer or Long, extract the integer value into a long named l1. If op1 is of type Integer or Long, extract the integer value into a long named l2. If either op1 or op2 is not an Integer or a Long, throw an exception. The methods will return their solution as a Long object.

The divide method will perform the operation l1 / l2. If l2 has the value of zero, throw an exception, different from the one above.

The code:
if (obj instanceof C) {
//your code
}

can be used to test the type of the object.

Turn in your code as a zip file.
